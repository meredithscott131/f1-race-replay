# 🏎️ F1 Race Replay

**Still Active in Development**

A Formula 1 race visualisation web app that turns accurate simulation data into an interactive, explorable, and playable experience. Built with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python backend powered by the FastF1 telemetry library.

> **Forked from [IAmTomShaw/f1-race-replay](https://github.com/IAmTomShaw/f1-race-replay).**
> This fork migrates the project to a full-stack React + TypeScript architecture while preserving the original Python data pipeline.

## Features

- **Accurate circuit rendering** — outer and inner track boundaries drawn from real coordinate data
- **Animated race replay** — driver positions interpolated and rendered frame-by-frame across the circuit
- **Leaderboard** — live leaderboard rendering, including driver positions, timing, and lap count
- **Playback Controls** - controls to fast forward/back, play/pause, and increase the speed of the race
- **DRS zone highlighting** — active DRS zones overlaid in green on the track boundary
- **Responsive UI** — scales and re-centers automatically on window resize

## Future Development Tasks
1. Race Selection (home) screen​

2. Reduce loading time (~120 seconds) of race simulation​

3. Driver filtering​

4. Driver name overlay toggling​

5. Race event popup system (safety car, red flags, etc.)​

6. Weather component​

7. Expanded simulation view​

8. Advanced loading screen with animations​

9. Game feature (ex. remix races with drivers from different years)
